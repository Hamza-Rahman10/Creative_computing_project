Project assignment:

During the development of my game,An existing source code gave me with a solid foundation and plenty of ideas. This enabled me to begin developing my own original idea from the bottom up. I was aware of the advantages of using earlier work, so I chose a project that fitted my conceptual goals and provided a solid, adaptable framework for future creation. Not only do I want to improve on what has already been done, but I also want to add many new features to the game and make it my own. Some were motivated by my prior lesson (introduction to programming), in which I initially experimented with game creation by constructing a 2D platformer in JavaScript.
